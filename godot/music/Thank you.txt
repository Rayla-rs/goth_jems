Hi, thanks for downloading my music!

All my SFX & music packs are available for free because I want to give something back to gamedevs for creating so many fun moments in my life through video games.
If you want to support this, I'd appreciate a little donation either directly through my itch.io page or PayPal: https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=LPYLXNMYPRQHC

If you want to go the extra mile and want to continuously support my work, I also have a patreon page for that:

In any case, thanks for stopping by & have fun making games! :D
