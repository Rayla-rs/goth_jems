** No-Fi Game Sounds **
** by Nicky Syst3m **

Thanks for downlaoding my game sounds.
These are all super lofi sounds, made using bytebeat or floatbeat systems.
Mathematical, logic and bitwise expressions are used here to generate sounds from a ramp.

The technique for the floatbeat sounds is done in Pure Data (www.puredata.info) using a method developed by @gabochi.

IF YOU USE THESE SAMPLES< PLESE CREDIT AND SHOW ME.
I wanna see your amazing work :)
